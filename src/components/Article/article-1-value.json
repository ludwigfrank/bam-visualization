                                "text":"Up  until  the  civil  rights  movement  in  the  1960s,  racial  segregation  was  widespread  in  American  hospitals.  In  some  cases,  often  in  the  South,  there  were  completely  separate  hospitals  for  white  people  and  hospitals  for  black  people,  the  latter  often  founded  by  black  physicians  who  were  denied  jobs  at  all-white  facilities.  Due  to  lack  of  resources  and  minimal  government  funding,  black  hospitals  were  often  unable  to  same  standard  of  treatment  as  the  all-white  hospitals.  Other  hospitals  admitted  all  racial  groups,  but  black  patients  were  treated  in  segregated  wards  of  poorer  quality,  often  in  basements  or  attics  with  limited  beds  and  improper  ventilation.  Upon  inspection  from  a  health  commissioner  in  1933,  Homer  G.  Phillips  Hospital  in  St.  Louis,  Missouri,  then  known  as  Hospital  #2,  the  city’s  only  hospital  serving  the  black  community  was  dubbed  “a  rat  hole,”  and  “filthy”  due  to  lack  of  resources (bam003_001_017.pdf).     Louis  T.  Wright,  who  became  the  first  African  American  surgeon  at  the  Harlem  Hospital  in  1919,  fought  throughout  his  career  to  desegregate  hospitals  and  raise  the  level  of  care  for  black  patients.  In  1933,  he  wrote  an  article  for  the  New  York  Herald  Tribune,  pointing  out  the  poor  working  and  living  conditions  for  black  doctors  in  Harlem (bam003_001_015.pdf).In  1929,  Wright  he  was  appointed  to  serve  as  the  first  African-American  police  surgeon  with  the  New  York  Police  Department (bam003_001_082.pdf).   In  1934,  he  founded  the  Harlem  Hospital  Bulletin  newsletter,  and  used  it  to  organize  hospital  staff  to  protest  unfair  conditions (bam003_001_001.pdf). In  the  newsletter’s  eight  volume,  Wright  lays  out  the  requests  of  his  peers  and  their  patients  to  city  officials,  including  more  hospital  beds;  more  nurses;  more  doctors  on  the  wards  and  in  the  clinics;  pay  for  out-patient  and  in-service  physicians  by  the  City  administration;  elimination  of  discrimination  regarding  doctors  and  the  democratic  election  of  the  Medical  Board  by  all  physicians  in  the  hospital;  and  expansion  of  the  Dental  Service.  “Certainly  all  public  spirited  citizens  and  civic  leaders  in  Harlem  will  agree  that  the  planks  of  this  program  follow  from  the  reality  of  the  lives  of  patients  and  physicians  in  Harlem  Community,”  wrote  Wright.    “Is  it  not  in  Harlem  where  slum  squalor  and  vicious  exploitation  of  Negro  workers  makes  resistance  against  disease  the  lowest  in  the  City?  Yet  hospital  facilities  are  still  the  worst  in  any  of  the  City’s  chain  of  twenty-seven  Municipal  Hospitals.  Is  it  not  in  Harlem  Hospital  that  hundreds  of  Negro  workers’  children,  who  need  tonsil  operations,  are  turned  away?  Is  it  not  in  Harlem  Hospital  where  patients  are  discharged  —not  infrequently—before  they  are  cured  in  order  to  make  room  for  others,  only  to  return  in  a  short  time  with  a  relapse?  Is  it  not  in  Harlem  Hospital  that  overcrowding  reached  its  peak  during  the  recent  Flu  epidemic?  Is  it  not  in  Harlem  Clinic  that  hundreds  of  Harlem’s  citizens  wait  long  hours  in  the  hot  basement  for  clinic  care,  only  to  be  turned  away  untreated  at  the  end  of  the  afternoon?”",

                                "text":"In  1932,  Wright,  a  veteran  of  WWI,  protested  two  Senate  bills  proposing  to  build  a  U.S.  Veteran’s  hospital  exclusively  for  black  veterans  and  add  a  295-bed  addition  for  black  patients  to  an  existing  hospital  in  Coatesville,  Pennsylvania.  An  article  (bam003_001_010.pdf) from  the  National  News  pointed  out  that  Coatesville  was  the  site  of  the  lynching  of  Zack  Walker  in  1912  and  therefore  not  an  appropriate  place  for  a  segregated  veteran’s  hospital.    Wright  was  quoted  in  the  article:  “This  is  part  of  a  dastardly  scheme,  general  throughout  the  country,  to  herd  injured  and  wounded  Negro  soldiers  into  jim-crow  hospitals  ...  Negro  veterans  throughout  the  country  should  rise  up  in  their  wrath  and  protest  against  this  rank  discrimination.”Facing  protests,  senators  backed  off  of  supporting  the  bill,  and  the  hospital  was  never  constructed  (003_001_011.pdf).     In  his  nearly  30-year  tenure  at  Harlem  Hospital,  Wright  continued  to  advocate  for  more  resources  to  improve  the  quality  of  its  patient  care  and  the  professional  lives  of  its  doctors.    In  the  1950s,  hospital  desegregation  efforts  were  led  in  part  by  Paul  B.  Cornely,  medical  director  of  Howard  Medical  School’s  Freedmen’s  Hospital,  and  his  colleague,  anthropologist  W.  Montague  Cobb.    In  1956,  the  pair  founded  Imhotep  National  Conferences,  which  convened  the  black  medical  community  with  the  goal  of  not  only  increasing  the  enrollment  of  African  Americans  into  segregated  medical  schools,  but  to  also  eliminate  segregation  in  hospitals.
